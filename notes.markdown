Lesson 1
--------

 * Formal/informal
 * No metaphores
 * More concise, as clear as possible
 * Conventional forms, abbreviations
 * Simpler grammar
 * No contractions (does not vs. doesn't)
 * No phrasals
 * Avoid "you" (use passive instead)
 * didn't give any ... -> gave no ...
 * not much -> little
 * not many -> few
 * Adverbs in the middle of the verb (e.g. "was originally developed")
 * Avoid direct questions

**Exercise 1**

 1. The results of this study can be used to recommend funding for further research.

    ATC system crash.
 3. The improved efficiency of the new system is clear.
 4. There has been no comprehensive study so far examining this branch/aspect of cloud
    technology.
 5. Many studies concluded that people will in the future use hand-held
    technology more than fixed computers.
    According to many studies, hand-held technology will in the future be used more
    than fixed computers.
